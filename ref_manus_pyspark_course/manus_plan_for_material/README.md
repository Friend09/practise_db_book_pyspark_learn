# PySpark Learning Repository

This repository is designed to help you learn and practice PySpark for data engineering, with a focus on the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). It's structured to facilitate hands-on learning in your local environment, mirroring the approach you'd use in Databricks.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains sample datasets and scripts to generate synthetic data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive PySpark development and exploration.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for PySpark jobs, often used for batch processing.
- `conf/`: Configuration files for PySpark applications (e.g., Spark session settings).

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java 17 and PySpark installed on your local machine. (You've already done this!)
2.  **Clone this repository**: `git clone <repository_url>` (Once this is a real repo, you'll put the URL here).
3.  **Explore the content**: Start by reviewing the notebooks and scripts in the respective directories.
4.  **Hands-on Practice**: Create your own notebooks and scripts, typing out the code and experimenting with different PySpark functionalities.
5.  **Refer to learning materials**: Use your preferred books and videos alongside this repository.
6.  **Ask for help**: If you get stuck, use your AI tool to assist you.

## Medallion Architecture Layers

This repository will provide examples for each layer:

-   **Bronze Layer**: Raw, untransformed data, ingested as-is from source systems.
-   **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, conformed, and enriched data, ready for business-level consumption.
-   **Gold Layer**: Highly aggregated and transformed data, optimized for analytics and reporting.

Let's get started with your PySpark journey!
